# IPython Extensions

Work in progress.

Contents:

* [Notebook theme toggle](#notebook-theme-toggle)
* [Notebook web notifications](#notebook-web-notifications)

## Notebook theme toggle

IPython notebook extension to toggle between two CSS themes, `theme_default.css` and `theme_alt.css`. If `theme_default.css` is not found, no CSS is loaded for the default setting, i.e. only the pre-installed default theme is used.

Installation:

    $ curl -L https://raw.github.com/sjpfenninger/ipython-extensions/master/nbextensions/theme_toggle.js > $(ipython locate)/nbextensions/theme_toggle.js
    $ curl -L https://raw.github.com/sjpfenninger/ipython-extensions/master/nbextensions/theme_alt.css > $(ipython locate)/nbextensions/theme_alt.css

Then, load it with the following code in your `custom.js`:

```javascript
IPython.load_extensions('theme_toggle');
```

To load the alternative theme (`theme_alt.css`) by default, add the following after the loading code:

```javascript
// Always load alternative theme
require(["nbextensions/theme_toggle"], function (theme_toggle) {
    $([IPython.events]).on("notebook_loaded.Notebook", theme_toggle.theme_toggle);
});
```

To enable a ``t`` as a keyboard shortcut, add the following after the loading code:

```javascript
// Enable keyboard shortcut
require(["nbextensions/theme_toggle"], function (theme_toggle) {
    $([IPython.events]).on("notebook_loaded.Notebook", theme_toggle.theme_toggle_shortcut);
});
```

## Notebook web notifications

IPython notebook extension to display a web notification to notify you when the IPython kernel becomes idle. This can be useful when running tasks that take more than a couple of seconds to complete.

The extension has been tested with the most recent versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari.

Initially, a button to request notification permissions is shown in the toolbar. After notification permissions have been granted, this button is replaced by a dropdown menu with five choices: `Disabled`, `0`, `5`, `10` and `30`. To activate notifications, select a minimum kernel busy time required to trigger a notification (e.g. if selecting `5`, a notification will only be shown if the kernel was busy for more than 5 seconds). The selection is saved in the notebook's metadata and restored when the notebook is re-opened.

Installation:

    $ curl -L https://raw.github.com/sjpfenninger/ipython-extensions/master/nbextensions/notify.js > $(ipython locate)/nbextensions/notify.js

Then, load it with the following code in your `custom.js`:

```javascript
IPython.load_extensions('notify');
```
